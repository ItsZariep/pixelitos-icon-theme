 ## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItzSelenux/pixelitos-icon-theme
```

> [!Note]
> Due to space problems in the repository, it only contains the 16x16 icons, so the 128x128 icons (which display correctly in the apps) need to be generated with ImageMagick. 

```
cd pixelitos-icon-theme
./compile-icons.sh
cd ../
```

```
mv pixelitos-icon-theme ~/.local/share/icons/pixelitos
```


### Folder colors
